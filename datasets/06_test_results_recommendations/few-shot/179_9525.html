It is named after Arnold Schwarzenegger, who used this move to help improve his shoulder development.</p>            <h3>Tips:</h3>            <p>1. Keep your back straight throughout the exercise.<br>            2. Do not use your legs or torso to lift the weights; your shoulders should do all the work.<br>            3. Perform the exercise slowly and with control, lowering the weights more slowly than you lift them.<br>            4. Do not use weights that are too heavy; it is better to use lighter weights and perform the exercise correctly.</p>        </div>    </div></body></html>
