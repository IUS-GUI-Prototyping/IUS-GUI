It targets both your front and side deltoids.</p>  <p>Steps: Sit on a flat bench, feet pointed forward and abs tight. Using an underhanded grip, grasp a dumbbell in each hand with elbows bent and palms facing in slightly below shoulder level. Using a steady controlled motion, raise the dumbbells while rotating your shoulders and turning your thumbs in to face each other.</p>  <p>Using a controlled motion, lower the dumbbells in the reverse manner to the starting position.</p>  <p>Tips: Avoid the Arnold Press if you are experiencing shoulder pain. Beginners should try this exercise with light weight to master the correct form. For most people, the rotator cuffs are underused. Keeping the weights light as you master the Arnold Press will help avoid injury.</p></body></html>
