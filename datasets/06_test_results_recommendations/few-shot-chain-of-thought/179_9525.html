Start by sitting on a bench with back support, holding a dumbbell in each hand at upper chest level with palms facing your body and elbows next to your torso. As you push the dumbbells up, rotate your palms until they face forward. Continue lifting the dumbbells until your arms are extended above you. Lower the dumbbells back to the initial position while rotating your palms towards you.</p><p class="tips">Tips: Keep your back flat against the bench throughout the exercise to avoid injury. Do not use your legs or torso to lift the weights; your shoulders should do the work.</p></div></div></body></html>
